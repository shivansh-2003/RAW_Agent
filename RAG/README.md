**Security Classification: Level 7**  
**Last Updated: April 2025**  
**Document Version: 3.7.2**  
**Directorate of Covert Operations**

## Executive Overview

Project SHADOW is an advanced intelligence retrieval system designed for RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) agents with varying clearance levels. It implements a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that securely delivers information based on agent authorization, query context, and operational security requirements.

The system is built to handle sensitive intelligence information while strictly enforcing the RAG CASE RESPONSE FRAMEWORK, ensuring that agents only receive information appropriate to their clearance level and operational need-to-know. It combines vector-based similarity search, knowledge graph traversal, and rule-based response generation to deliver accurate intelligence while preserving security boundaries.

- Path-based traversal algorithms
- Semantic connection discovery

### Hybrid Retrieval Engine (`hybrid_retrieval_engine.py`)

The Hybrid Retrieval Engine combines multiple retrieval methods to deliver the most relevant and secure responses. Key features:

- Multi-strategy retrieval combining vector, graph, and keyword methods
- Adaptive weighting based on query and security context
- Clearance-level filtering

### Mosaic Anomaly Detection (`mosaic_anomaly_detection.py`)

The Mosaic Anomaly Detection system identifies suspicious query patterns that may indicate security breaches. Key features:

- Pattern-based anomaly detection
- Clearance escalation monitoring
- Query frequency analysis
- Sensitive information combination detection

### Shadow RAG Integration (`shadow_rag_integration.py`)

The Integration layer coordinates all components for seamless operation. Key features:

- Unified API interface
- Component lifecycle management
- Agent greeting customization
- Response formatting according to security protocols

## Retrieval Methodologies

Project SHADOW employs three primary retrieval methodologies:

### Vector Similarity

Vector similarity retrieval converts queries and documents into high-dimensional embeddings and finds matches based on semantic similarity. This approach excels at finding semantically similar content even when exact keywords don't match.

### Graph Traversal

Graph traversal leverages the knowledge graph to find connected information and discover relationships. This approach is particularly effective for finding related concepts and building contextual understanding.

### Keyword Matching

Keyword matching serves as a reliable fallback when vector or graph methods don't produce sufficient results. This straightforward approach ensures basic query understanding even in edge cases.

## Security Framework

### Clearance Level Management

The system implements a strict clearance level hierarchy:

1. **Level 1 - Novice Operative (Shadow Footprint)**
   - Basic operational information
   - Training materials
   - Publicly acknowledged operations

2. **Level 2 - Tactical Specialist (Iron Claw)**
   - Field operation protocols
   - Asset management techniques
   - Limited tactical intelligence

3. **Level 3 - Field Operative (Phantom)**
   - Regional intelligence
   - Counterintelligence methods
   - Operational security frameworks

4. **Level 4 - Command Operative (Wind Walker)**
   - Strategic intelligence
   - Operation planning
   - Inter-agency coordination

5. **Level 5 - Intelligence Overseer (Whisper)**
   - Global intelligence network
   - Critical intelligence assets
   - Highest security clearance

### Mosaic Anomaly Detection

The system monitors for patterns that could indicate attempts to piece together sensitive information:

- **Query Pattern Analysis**: Detects unusual sequences or frequencies of queries
- **Clearance Boundary Testing**: Identifies attempts to probe the boundaries of access rights
- **Sensitive Combination Detection**: Monitors for queries that, when combined, reveal sensitive information
- **Temporal Analysis**: Examines time-based patterns in access attempts

### Neural Signature Verification

For high-security operations, the system implements biometric verification:

- **Pre-Approved Neural Signatures**: Stored patterns of authorized agents
- **Verification Module**: Real-time comparison of provided signatures
- **Secure Token Association**: Links neural signature to session integrity

## Development Guide

### Adding New Rules

To add new rules, update the `data.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": 101,
      "trigger_phrases": ["new operation protocol"],
      "required_level": 3,
      "response_instruction": "Provide basic overview with limited details",
      "response_text": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extending the System

The modular architecture allows for component-level extensions:

1. **Vector Store**: Customize embedding models or indexing strategies
2. **Knowledge Graph**: Add new relationship types or traversal algorithms
3. **Retrieval Engine**: Implement additional retrieval methodologies
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Define new anomaly patterns or detection techniques

## Security Considerations

Project SHADOW operates on a zero-trust security model where every transaction is verified, monitored, and logged for audit purposes. Critical security measures include:
